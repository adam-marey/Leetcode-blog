## Vaild Palindrome

`Difficulty: Easy, Frequency: Medium`

**Source on Leetcode:** [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

A phrase is a `palindrome` if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.


**Example:**

```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

```
**Example:**

```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```

```js
var isPalindrome = function(s) {
    s = s.toLowerCase();
    let alphanumeric = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789";
    let filtered = "";
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (alphanumeric.includes(s[i])) {
            filtered += s[i];
        }
    }
    return filtered === filtered.split("").reverse().join("");
};
```

**Time complexity:**


The time complexity of this function is `O(n)`, where n is the length of the input string `s`.

The function performs two main operations: filtering the alphanumeric characters from the input string, and checking if the filtered string is a palindrome.

The first operation uses a for loop to iterate through each character in the string and adds it to a new string `filtered` if it is included in the `alphanumeric` string. The time required for this operation is proportional to the length of the input string, so its time complexity is O(n).

The second operation uses the built-in `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods to reverse the filtered string and compare it to the original. These operations each take O(n) time, so the overall time complexity of the second operation is O(n).

The total time complexity of the function is `O(n) + O(n) = O(n)`.
