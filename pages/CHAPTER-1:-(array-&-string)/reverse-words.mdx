## Reverse Words in a String

`Difficulty: Medium, Frequency: High`

**Source on Leetcode:** [Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

**Example:**

```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

**Example:**

```
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

```js
var reverseWords = function(s) {
    return s.split(" ").filter(word => word).reverse().join(" ");
};

// Explanation:
// split(" ") splits the string into an array of words using a single space as the separator.
// split(" ") splits the string into an array of words using a single space as the separator.
// reverse() reverses the order of elements in the array.
// join(" ") concatenates the elements in the array into a single string using a single space as the separator.
```
**Time complexity:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n).

The `split` operation takes `O(n)` time because it has to traverse the entire string `s` once to split it into words.

The filter operation also takes `O(n`) time because it also has to traverse the entire array of words to remove any empty strings.

The reverse operation takes `O(n/2)` time on average because it swaps the elements in the middle of the array.

The join operation takes `O(n)` time because it has to concatenate all the words in the array into a single string.

So, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.
