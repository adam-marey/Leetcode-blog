## Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

`Difficulty: Medium, Frequency: Medium`

**Source on Leetcode:** [Valid Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-number/)

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For
example, the longest substring without repeating letters for `“abcabcbb”` is `“abc”`, which
the length is `3`. For `“bbbbb”` the longest substring is `“b”`, with the length of `1`.

**Example:**

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```js
const lengthOfLongestSubstring = str => {
    // Initialize the maximum length of the longest substring without repeating characters
    let max_length = 0;
    // Initialize the current length of the substring without repeating characters
    let current = 0;
    // Initialize a hash table to store characters as keys and their indices as values
    let hash = {}; 
    
    // If the input string has less than 2 characters, return the length of the string
    if(str.length < 2) {
        return str.length;
    }
    
    // Iterate over the input string
    for(let i = 0; i < str.length;  i++) {
        // If the current character is not in the hash table
        if(hash[str[i]] == null) {
            // Increment the current length of the substring without repeating characters
            current += 1;
        } else {
            // Update the current length of the substring without repeating characters
            // by taking the minimum of the difference between the current index and the previous index of the character, 
            // and the current length plus 1
            current = Math.min(i - hash[str[i]], current + 1);
        }
        
        // Update the maximum length of the longest substring without repeating characters
        max_length = Math.max(max_length, current);
        // Update the hash table with the current character and its index
        hash[str[i]] = i; 
    }
    // Return the maximum length of the longest substring without repeating characters
    return max_length;
};

```
**Time complexity:**

The time complexity of this code is `O(n)`, where n is the length of the input string. This is because in the worst case scenario, the code iterates through the entire string and updates the hash object and the current and max_length variables once for each character in the string. The hash object allows for constant time lookups and updates, so the overall time complexity is linear in the size of the input.
