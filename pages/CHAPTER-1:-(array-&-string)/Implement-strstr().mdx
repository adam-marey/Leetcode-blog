## Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
`Difficulty: Easy, Frequency: High`


Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the `index` of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.


**Example:**

```
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

```
**Example:**

```
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
```

```js
var strStr = function(haystack, needle) {
    for (let hIdx = 0; hIdx <= haystack.length - needle.length; hIdx++) {
    //O(n * ...) where n is the number of letters in haystack
    for (let nIdx = 0; nIdx < needle.length; nIdx++) {
      //O(m * ...) where m is the number of letters in needle
      if (haystack[hIdx + nIdx] !== needle[nIdx]) break;
      //O(1) constant
      if (nIdx + 1 === needle.length) return hIdx;
      //O(1) constant
    }
  }
  return -1;
};
```

**Time complexity:**

The time complexity of this function is `O(n * m)`, where n is the number of characters in the haystack and `m` is the number of characters in the needle.

The function uses nested for loops to compare the characters of the needle with the characters of a sub-string of the haystack, starting from each possible starting index in the haystack.

The outer loop has a complexity of `O(n - m + 1)`, as it runs `n - m + 1` times, where n is the length of the haystack and `m` is the length of the needle.

The inner loop has a complexity of `O(m)`, as it runs `m` times, where m is the length of the needle.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is `O((n - m + 1) * m) = O(n * m)`.
