## Two Sum

`Difficulty: Easy, Frequency: High`

**Source on Leetcode:** [two sum I](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)


Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return `indices` of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

```

```js
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  // Declare an empty object to store the complement value of each number
  let map = {};
  
  // Iterate through each element in the nums array
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    // Calculate the complement of the current element by subtracting it from the target value
    let complement = target - nums[i];
    
    // If the complement of the current element is found in the map object, return the indices of the two elements
    if (map[complement] !== undefined) {
      return [map[complement], i];
    }
    
    // Store the current element and its index in the map object for future reference
    map[nums[i]] = i;
  }
}
```
**Time complexity:**

The time complexity of this function is `O(n)`.
The function uses a single for loop to iterate through each element in the nums array, and for each iteration, it performs a constant amount of work (calculating the complement, checking if it's in the map, and storing the element in the map if it's not).
Therefore, the time required for this function grows linearly with the size of the input array, making its time complexity O(n).
